# Data Driven Job Search
We believe that combining our job search data together enables individual members to improve their job search strategy

## Vision Statement
Create a contributory data exchange for tracking applicant progress through interview loops. Members can leverage this data to identify the most successful job search strategies and direct applicants to the most relevant roles

We hope to reverse the toxic flywheel of people applying to more and more jobs and companies being overwhelmed with more and more applicants. We want to create a new flywheel where applicants can focus on fewer opportunities they are more likely to get, and recruiters end up with fewer but higher quality candidates to review. Ultimately finding better fits between candidates and roles with less overall work for both parties.

## Philosophy
- Bias, whether it is location, pedigree, gender, or race, is an inherent part of the hiring process. We hope to provide candidates with insights on potential bias for and against candidates at different roles and companies so they can focus their time on roles where they will be most welcome.
- We believe bias exists both on an organizational and individual level so we will attempt to identify bias at both the organizational level and individual interviewer level as the interviewer moves across organizations
