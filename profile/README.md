# Data Driven Job Search
We believe that combining our job search data together enables individual members to improve their job search strategy

## Vision Statement
Create a contributory data exchange for tracking applicant progress through interview loops. Members can leverage this data identify the most successful job search strategies and direct applicants to the most relevant roles

## Philosophy
- Bias whether it location, pedigree, gender, or race is an inherent part of the hiring process. We hope to provide candidates with insights on potential bias for and against cannidates at different roles and companies so they can focus their time on roles where they will be most welcome.
- We belive bias exists both on an orginizational and indivudal level so we will attempt to identify bias at both the instutional level and individual interviewer level as the interviewer moves across organizations
